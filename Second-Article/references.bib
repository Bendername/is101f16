    abstract ={ Defining “emotion” is a notorious problem. Without consensual conceptualization and operationalization
                  of exactly what phenomenon is to be studied, progress in theory and research is difficult to achieve
                  and fruitless debates are likely to proliferate. A particularly unfortunate example is William James’s
                  asking the question “What is an emotion?” when he really meant “feeling”, a misnomer that started a
                  debate which is still ongoing, more than a century later. This contribution attempts to sensitize
                  researchers in the social and behavioral sciences to the importance of definitional issues and their
                  consequences for distinguishing related but fundamentally different affective processes, states, and
                  traits. Links between scientific and folk concepts of emotion are explored and ways to measure emotion
                  and its components are discussed.  },

abstract = "Emotion is a key aspect of user experience. To design a user interface for positive emotional experience,
                  the affective quality of the user interface needs to be carefully considered. A major factor of
                  affective quality in today's user interface for digital media is interactivity, in which motion
                  feedback plays a significant role as an element. This role of motion feedback is particularly evident
                  in touchscreen user interfaces that have been adopted rapidly in mobile devices. This paper presents
                  two empirical studies performed to increase our understanding of motion feedback in terms of affective
                  quality in mobile touchscreen user interfaces. In the first study, the relationships between three
                  general motion properties and a selected set of affective qualities are examined. The results of this
                  study provide a guideline for the design of motion feedback in existing mobile touchscreen user
                  interfaces. The second study explores a new dimension of interactivity that is the Weight factor of
                  Laban's Effort system. To experiment the Weight factor in a mobile touchscreen user interface, a
                  pressure sensitive prototype was developed to recognize the amount of force applied by the user's
                  finger action. With this prototype, the effects of implementing pressure requirements on four
                  different types of user interfaces were examined. Results show that implementing the Weight factor can
                  significantly influence the affective quality and complement the physical feel of a user
                  interface. The issues to consider for effective implementation are also discussed. "
