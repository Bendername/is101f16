\section{Research Question}
The focus of this paper is to improve the process of making usability tests. 
As it is clear from the intro and related review, this has been attempted multiple times, however, all those attempts are sorrounding an improvement of traditional methods.
In this paper a method using physiological data directly from the system user is proposed.
Multiple consumer graded sensors are used to gather physiological data on which machine learning techniques are applied to predict changes in the affective state of the user and from that determine if a usability problem is present in the system used. The study is explorative in nature because of the limited research already conducted within this field. 
The focus will be to identify specific areas of interest for reasearchers in terms of using sensors and affective state changes to find usability problems.\todo{READ THIS MOTHER FUCKERS}
