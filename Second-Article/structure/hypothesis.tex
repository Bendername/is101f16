\section{Research Question}
The focus of this paper is to improve the process of making usability tests. 
As it is clear from the intro and litterature review, this has been attempted multiple times, however, all those attempts are sorrounding an improvement of traditional methods.
In this paper a method using physiological data directly from the system user is proposed.
Multiple consumer graded sensors are used to gather physiological data on which machine learning techniques are applied to predict the affective state of the user and from that determine if a usability problem is present in the system used.
