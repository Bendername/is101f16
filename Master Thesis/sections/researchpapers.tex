\chapter{Research Papers}
This chapter presents two research papers, both produced during our Master
Thesis semester. The first paper is produced in collaboration with another
workgroup, and the second produced entirely by us.

The first paper is a continuation of our work during 9th semester which includes
a significant literature review investigating the occurrence of research making
use of physiological measurement, and in particular research relying on fusing
several physiological measurements, in order to identify emotions and affective
state. Our 9th semester project formulates a setup and in it we conduct a
proof-of-concept experiment and arrive at promising results. The first paper
scales the experimental setup substantially, in order to more convincingly
confirm or reject its hypothesis.

The second paper builds upon the first, and aims to use its results in a more
specific manner: to identify usability problems solely by physiological
measurements. Based on the assumption from related work, that usability problems
induce a negative affective state, often discretized as \textit{frustration},
our aim was to identify such states and thereby usability problems.

Below is a short summary of each paper along with its research questions.
Followed by that, is a methodical reflection, wherein we scrutinize and discuss
our findings and methods. Each paper can be found in its full length in the
Appendix.


\section{Research paper 1}
\paragraph{Title:}
Real-time Measurement of User Experience
\paragraph{Hypothesis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H1:} There is a statistically significant
      correlation between subjective SAM ratings and physiological
      measurements from consumer-grade sensors.
    \item \textbf{H2:} Statistically, fusion of consumer-grade sensors
      has a significantly higher prediction rate than each sensor
      individually.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Summary:} Today it is Wednesday
