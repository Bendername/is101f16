\chapter{Research Papers}
This chapter presents two research papers, both produced during our Master
Thesis semester. The first paper is produced in collaboration with another
workgroup, and the second produced entirely by us.

The first paper is a continuation of our work during 9th semester which includes
a significant literature review investigating the occurrence of research making
use of physiological measurement, and in particular research relying on fusing
several physiological measurements, in order to identify emotions and affective
state. Our 9th semester project formulates a setup and in it we conduct a
proof-of-concept experiment and arrive at promising results. The first paper
scales the experimental setup substantially, in order to more convincingly
confirm or reject its hypothesis.

The second paper builds upon the first, and aims to use its results in a more
specific manner: to identify usability problems solely by physiological
measurements. Based on the assumption from related work, that usability problems
induce a negative affective state, often discretized as \textit{frustration},
our aim was to identify such states and thereby usability problems.

Below is a short summary of each paper along with its research questions.
Followed by that, is a methodical reflection, wherein we scrutinize and discuss
our findings and methods. Each paper can be found in its full length in the
Appendix.

\section{Research paper 1}
\paragraph{Title:}
Real-time Measurement of User Experience
\paragraph{Hypothesis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H1:} There is a statistically significant
      correlation between subjective SAM ratings and physiological
      measurements from consumer-grade sensors.
    \item \textbf{H2:} Statistically, fusion of consumer-grade sensors
      has a significantly higher prediction rate than each sensor
      individually.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Summary:}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the field of study
\item What is the paper trying to investigate
\item How did it investigate
\item Explain experiment
\item Present results
\end{itemize}

The paper is based on our 9th semester project, which consisted primarily of an
elaborate literature review within the field of HCI. The purpose was to
investigate the use of sensors within UX research and experiments. In
particular, to investigate their use in eliciting emotions or affective state in
UX test participants. The argument for using sensors in such cases, is that
eliciting how test participants feel during an experiment is often left to be
evaluated by third-party experts, leaving room for subjective assessments. Using
sensors could potentially mitigate subjectivity, and help elicit more objective
truths about how test participants feel and react during experiments.

The conclusion was that while the use of sensors has increased in recent years,
it is still not the predominant method, or even a particular popular method for
eliciting emotions. Furthermore, the use of multiple sensor was even
rarer. Although not always mentioned explicitly in the reviewed material, it was
sometimes stated that further work was needed and results between studies varied
in accuracy. The reviewed material also proposed disparate methods, rarely
agreeing on how sensor data should be processed, or fused in the case of
multiple sensors.

Our 9th semester project was motivated by the presumption that more promising
results could be produced by using multiple sensors and fusing their results. It
also proposed the use of consumer-grade hardware in order to make our findings
more accessible. Common Machine Learning techniques and statistical methods for
data-processing were proposed as well, again to make our findings easily
reproducible and accessible. The project describes a setup for experiments onto
which the above can be applied. The setup involves multiple sensors such as GSR,
EEG and heart-rate monitoring, and emotions were artificially induced using
images having positive, neutral and negative connotations, selected from the
reputable IAPS collection. However, while promising results were found, a lack
in test participants make them particularly case-specific, and further study is
required in order to verify them.

This paper is, as mentioned, based on the above preliminary research. The
primary motivation for the work was to remedy shortcomings in our 9th semester
project. In particular, with an increased number of test participants, our aim
was to confirm that using multiple sensors produce better results. Refining the
setup and conducting it in a proper testing environment yielded a more
controlled experiment. In particular, our test-software was significantly
revised and more thoroughly tested for bugs, additional literature was consulted
w.r.t. feature extraction for the ML technique and the experiment procedure was
adjusted and formalized. Due to the experiment now being conducted in a
usability lab, we took advantage of the additional video-recording capabilities,
and recorded both participants' facial expressions, the computer screen while
they interacted with the software, and the setup from behind-the-shoulders of
the test participants. And with a substantial increase in participants, we
produced similar but more convincing results compared to our previous work.

In conclusion, it was confirmed that using multiple sensors, fusing their input
using ML techniques, produces more accurate results compared to each individual
sensor. Furthermore, we found the presumption that self-reported SAM ratings
during the experiment correlated with the physiological measurements taken
simultaneously, to be true.

\subsection{Methodical Reflection:}
In this section, we discuss the methods and practices we applied in this paper,
which by extension also includes the preliminary work in our 9th semester
project.
\\

Things to discuss:
\todo{below is just a list of things we could discuss in this section}
\begin{itemize}
\item context
\item shcrierer
\item misunderstanding SAM
\item results are held against test participants own subjective SAM ratings
\item the one-one, one-many etc. statement that I can't remember where I read
\end{itemize}
